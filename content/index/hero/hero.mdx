#### **Who are we & what we do?**
We are 2 Melbourne based tech heads with a keen interest to learn all the ins and outs of the AWS ecosystem

While we could do this in isolation, we thought our journey would be more fun if we connected
with other individuals/small organisations in the community that need a solution built on AWS

Thus we would like to volunteer our time and skills to create some truly great web applications 
for you while at the same time building up our experience on the AWS platform

#### **Who are you?**
We are just starting out, so we do not want to be too specific at this time. That said, we are ideally looking to work with
individuals or small organisations such as:

- Small sport clubs
- Small interest groups
- Any individual with a passion and interesting idea
