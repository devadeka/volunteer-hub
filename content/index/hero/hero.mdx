Who are we & what we do?

We are 2 software developers (Deva and Steve) with over 8 years experience with various technologies.
Both of us pride ourselves in our ability to keep up to date and relevant with technology, which is why
we are keen to gather more experience with the various AWS offerings. While we can do this in isolation,
which we are all too familiar with [SIGH], we wanted to branch out and see if we can help anyone else
while one our journey.

Both of us have a keen interest in technology, however we have not had a big opportunity to explore AWS to-date.
Given the multitude of AWS options we are confident the stack can keep our appetite at bay so long as we have interesting
projects to work on (this is where you come in)[POINTER].

It's true that both of us are creative in our own ways, however our imagination can only go as far as we can see, which is why
we want to invite others with a genuine need to reach out. We would like to volunteer our time and skills to create some truly great
web applications for you while at the same time building up our experience on the AWS platform.

Who are you?
We are just starting out, so we do not want to be too specific at this time. That said, we are ideally looking to work with
individuals or small organisations such as:

- Sport Clubs
- Smaller interest groups
